  title1: "What Is An Animal Shelter?",
  description1:
    "An animal shelter is a staffed facility where homeless animals—and   animals seized by authorities in cruelty cases—find safety and   comfort, are cared for, and are made available for adoption.  Temporarily housing animals in shelters keeps them from being loose   on the streets, where they struggle to find clean food and water,   can be hit by cars, can be attacked by other animals or cruel   humans, or face other potential dangers.",
  title2: "What Do Animal Shelters Do?",
  description2:
    "Approximately 7.6 million companion pets are surrendered to a   shelter every year; 4.2 million are dogs and 1.4 million dogs are  euthanized. Animals have no voice of their own, no social safety net   and very few rights under the law. They are vulnerable and,  unfortunately, mistreated more often than most of us would like to  think.",
  title3: "Why You Should Donate?",
  description3:
    "Shelters and rescue operations for pets need donations from the   community to operate. Many animal shelters do not have the resources   they need to care for sick or injured animals. Approximately 80 percent of animals that are euthanized are healthy or treatable and   could have been adopted into new homes. Senior dogs and bully breeds  are also high on the list of dogs that are at-risk for euthanasia.",

  subtitle1: "Make a donation",
  description4:
    "Financial donations make a HUGE difference for animal charities.  Donating money is fast, easy and allows facilities to use the  money where it is needed most. If the nonprofit group you’re  donating to is recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization,  you can deduct the value of your contribution from any taxes you  owe.",
  description5:
    " Animal shelters need food, bedding and other supplies. Many need  veterinarian care, medical assistance and spaying/neutering. Your  donations will help provide the care abandoned animals need until  a suitable home is found for them.",

    "However, if you can’t donate money, don’t despair – there are  other ways you can help!",

    "If you’ve been considering adopting a new dog, think twice before  buying one from a pet store. Your local shelter or rescue  operation may have the perfect dog for you! Look for  breed-specific rescue programs if you have your heart set on a  certain breed.",
  description28:
    " Adopting a dog from a shelter may save his or her life, and will  make room for another animal in need. Share your experience with  your family and friends, and hopefully they will consider adopting  a shelter pet the next time they are ready for a new four-legged  family member.",
