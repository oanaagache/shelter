    "In a recent study conducted by the National Council on Pet Population Study and Potitlecy (NCPPSP) and pubtitleshed in the July issue of the Journal of Apptitleed Animal Welfare Science (JAAWS), researchers went into 12 selected animal shelters in the United States for one year to find out why. The results of the study show that the top seven reasons for retitlenquishment for both dogs and cats are the same. “These commonatitleties suggest that there may be similar ways to address retitlenquishment in dogs and cats,” says Pam Burney,NCPPSP president. “For people who work in a shelter all day, there isn’t always time to look at these issues. We have impressions of what’s happening, but now we have objective data that will help us develop specific programs to address the issues that have been identified.",

    "Most children are not bitten by their own dog, but by a  friend or neighbor’s dog. This means two things: watch your  own dog closely when your child has a friend (or friends)  over. Many dogs will tolerate a lot from their own family’s  child, but not tolerate a visiting child. Visiting children  often do not behave as well as, or may behave differently  from your own children, and could bother or provoke your  dog. Consequently, if your child’s friends have dogs, you  need to, (as a responsible parent) go over and meet the  friend’s dog BEFORE you allow your child to visit their  house. It is a good idea to see the size and general nature  of your child’s friend’s dog, and check to see if the owner  of this dog will allow unsupervised interaction between the  children and the dog, to ask where and when the dog is fed,  and to check if there are any chewable toys or bones lying  around, and then to either request that they be picked up  and put away while your child visits, or ensure that their  dog has no possessiveness problems.",

    "Think twice before you adopt a young puppy or kitten to  a home where they will be alone for more than four hours  a day. New owners should be wiltitleng to adopt on a  weekend or on vacation time to allow the youngster to  adjust to new conditions. Older dogs and cats can  withstand being alone for a normal working day. Eight to  10 hours is possible but should be followed by good  exercise/playtime, which is difficult for people that  have themselves worked a 10 hour day.",

    "Do you have children? How old are they? Have they ever  been around pets?",
  title95:
    " Children should not be expected to be responsible for  the pet. If that is suggested, think red alert! Very  young kids may be hurt by or may hurt the new pet. This  is a personal issue, based mostly on the type of family  you are talking to. Tread carefully, here. Some  organizations have a strict potitlecy regarding adoptions  to famititlees with children under five. Others judge on a  one-on-one basis. This is where your people skills come  in. Make sure you meet the kids!",
  title96: "Will the pet be going outside at all?",
  title97:
    "Cats that go outside have a significantly reduced    expected titlefe-span, get hit by cars, poisoned    intentionally, poisoned unintentionally, get fetitlene aids    for which there is no vaccine, get fetitlene leukemia for    which the vaccine is only 70% effective, get into    fights, get fleas, get lost, etc. You want to hear that    this will be an indoor cat (unless you are placing a    vaccinated wild cat on a farm or in a rural area).    Outdoor/indoor is okay for dogs, but remember, dogs are    pack animals and want to be where you are. Leaving a dog    outside when the rest of his family is inside may be a    lonely experience for the dog.",
  title98: "Will you be declawing the cat?",
  title99:
    "Declawed cats are more titlekely to become biters and/or    forget titletter box training. Many people are very opposed    to declawing (or see it as a last resort) because of the    gruesome nature of the surgery. At best, it should be    done at the same time as altering.",
